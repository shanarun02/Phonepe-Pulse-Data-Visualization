Phonepe Pulse Dashboard
Overview
This repository contains a solution for extracting, transforming, and visualizing data from the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository. The goal is to provide users with a user-friendly and interactive dashboard that displays valuable insights and information.

Solution Steps
1. Data Extraction
Clone the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository using scripting to fetch the data and store it in a suitable format, such as CSV or JSON.

2. Data Transformation
Utilize Python and Pandas to manipulate and pre-process the data. This involves cleaning the data, handling missing values, and transforming it into a format suitable for analysis and visualization.

3. Database Insertion
Connect to a MySQL database using the "mysql-connector-python" library and insert the transformed data using SQL commands.

4. Dashboard Creation
Create an interactive and visually appealing dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly in Python. The dashboard will utilize Plotly's geo map functions to display data on a map, and Streamlit will provide a user-friendly interface with multiple dropdown options for selecting different facts and figures.

5. Data Retrieval
Use the "mysql-connector-python" library to connect to the MySQL database and dynamically fetch the data into a Pandas dataframe. Update the dashboard with the latest data.

6. Deployment
Ensure the solution is secure, efficient, and user-friendly. Thoroughly test the solution and deploy the dashboard publicly, making it accessible to users.

Results
The result of this project is a live geo visualization dashboard accessible from a web browser. Users can easily navigate through different visualizations and select various facts and figures using dropdown options. The dashboard provides valuable insights and information about the data in the Phonepe Pulse GitHub repository.
